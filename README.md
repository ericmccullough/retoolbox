XOR

This started as a exercise in javascript.  The xor.html can be run standalone in a browser.  There are no javascript libraries used to make it easier to use on a machine without internet access. 

The ruby code is a Sinatra server whose only purpose is to serve the xor.html.  I used that so I could deploy it without setting up Apache etc.
