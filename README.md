###Reverse Engineering Toolbox

Originally this Sinatra server's only purpose was to serve an xor.html webpage.  I used it so I could deploy that without setting up Apache etc.
Continuing to add additional paths as I make more little utility pages.

Included repositories:

[xor](https://github.com/ericmccullough/xor)

[Vinself Decoder](https://github.com/ericmccullough/vinself_decoder)

[Unicode Decoder](https://github.com/ericmccullough/unidecode)

[Change Base](https://github.com/ericmccullough/change_base)
